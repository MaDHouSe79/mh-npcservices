### MH 6 in 1 NPC Services Script by MaDHouSe
- NPC Police    - Transport you to police HQ jail, this with 2 agent peds with a riot vehicle.
- NPC Ambulance - Transport you to the hospital, this with 2 ambulance peds.
- NPC Mechanic  - Repare your vehicle on location, this with 1 mechanic ped.
- NPC Towtruck  - Transport your vehicle and your self, to the mechanic shop, this with 1 ped. (depending on vehicle damage)
- NPC Taxi      - Take you where ever you want on the map.(just set a waypoint and call a taxi)
- NPC Limo      - Take you where ever you want on the map in style .(just set a waypoint and call a limo)


### Dont forget to edit the qb-smallresources/config.lua 
- Go to resources/[qb]/qb-smallresources/config.lua look for (Config.BlacklistedVehs)
- Set vehicles in to false so it can spawn in.


## How it works
- If you want to use the taxi, you need to add a waypoint first cause it will not show in the menu if you dont have a waypoint.
- If you want to use the mechanic or towtruck you need to sit in your vehicle when you call.
- If you want to use the ambulance, it calls automatic, but you can alse call for other players aswell.
- if you want to use the police, you can call at any point where you are.

## NOTE Open Source, at least give me the credit for making this script.
- Don't act if you created this script, you can change stuff or use stuff, i don't care.
- But give me atleast the credits for making it, and give it for free to everyone.
- if you have paid for this script, you have been scammed, this script is free to everyone.
- not encrypted, not ip blocked.
